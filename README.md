# TwentyFortyEight

A simple implementation of the 2048 game written in Elixir and Phoenix for the purpose of learning.

To start 2048:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
